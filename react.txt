    b. this.props can not be modified in child component which is passed from parent componet as properties in html. -Solution: State can be modified inside child component 
    c. Whenever the state changes (via the this.setState() function), the component will rerender.
    d. componentWillUnmount() callback. This is the time to handle any clean-up events we might need, such as clearing timeouts, clearing data, disconnecting websockets, etc
