# About Laravel
============================
https://www.resourcifi.com/blog/why-laravel-is-a-good-choice-in-2019/

  So, we have talked a lot about Laravel and understood as to why Laravel is a good choice in 2019

  Laravelâ€™s fundamental concepts include Routing, Views, Eloquent ORM, Controllers, Middleware, Models & Migrations, Requests, and Responses.

  Middleware bridges the gap between a request and a response.

  Laravel possess the most potent ORM (Object-relational Mapping)

  These libraries make the life of dedicated Laravel developers easier by facilitating easy implementation features like active user checking, Bcrypt hash, password reset, CSRF(Cross Site Request Falsification) Protection, Encryption and many more.

  Laravel development services includes many security features like authentication system, reduce vulnerabilities From CSRF (cross-site request forgery), 
  protection against XSS (cross-site scripting), SQL Injection, secured cookies, forcing HTTPS when exchanging sensitive data and more. 
  Also, due to its large and active community support, any loophole found in security is handled immediately by the skilled members.
